%v, je stelt niks voor!
Sorry, %v. Je stond in de weg.
Je vloog best hoog, %v.
Ik moet het gewoon doen, %v. Je begrijpt me wel...
Je had moeten rennen toen het nog kon, %v.
Ik ben altijd beter geweest, %v. Altijd.
Je vind het vast vreselijk als dat gebeurt he, %v?
Pak aan!, %v !
Kom op, %v! Je hebt me al bijna pijn gedaan!
Ha...ha!
Je bent niks, %v. Helemaal niks.
%v ik maak me zorgen om je...
Sorry %v, mijn Headshot Script is beter dan die van jou.

Is het al tijd voor een andere map?
Stelletje kut-campers.

Spectator zijn zuigt...
Ik wou dat een goede speler langkwam.
Dat zag er pijnlijk uit...
Dit is best leuk.
Ik wist niet dat iemand zo slecht kon spelen.
Waarom doet iedereen me pijn? :)
Kom naar http://www.nuclearbox.com/podbot/
Mijn pols doet pijn...
Deze map is KUT!
Ik heb een slechte dag...
Dood aan alle campers!
Zouden ze ooit ophouden met campen?
Ik ben beter in Q3, dat is zeker...
Denk je niet dat Android bot beter is?
Botman is echt heel cool.
Stomme bots!
Kijk toch naar deze sukkels...
Mijn kleine zusje speelt beter!
Ik ben vandaag zo moe...
Ik moet echt gaan slapen...
Normaal ben ik niet zo slecht!
Geen DE_DUST vandaag, alsjeblieft!
Ik haat deze map!
Ze kunnen alleen maar snipen...
Volgende ronde ram ik je in elkaar!
Stem voor een mapchange!!!
Zit er al een Bot vast?

Boooooom !!! *lol*
Insane in the membrane, hehe!
Gebruikte Guy een Aiming Proxy !
Zitten er bots in dit spel?
Geef me je headshot-script even ok?
Volgende ronde blijven we bij elkaar.
Fuck de Teamkillers!!!
Ik ben niet zo goed in ladders...
Waar zijn Clans nou voor?
Ken je de Jumbot ? die kickt echt Aars!
Fucking lag!!
Jammer dat de Androidbot zo zelden wordt geupdate...
Ik ga effe een sigaret roken...
Waarom zitten er eigenlijk voertuigen in Cs?
Ik moest gewoon effe reloaden...

# Start of the "dynamic" replies from here
# After each @KEY Tag you need to specify the
# keywords in quotation marks and uppercase. You can
# have several keywords (aliases) each separated by a comma.
# After the keywords line, the answers or messages to this
# special keyword need to be given. In theory there can be an unlimited
# number of answers of course you should care about the used memory ;)

@KEY " AGAIN "
%s, things are always repeating - aren't they?
And I'm sure it wasn't the last time...
That's the way things go, hey...

@KEY "AIMBOT", "WALLHACK"
%s, are you cheating ?
Even PunkBuster fails to detect some of them...
You can't be sure nowadays if someones's good at playing or cheats
Aimbots are cool, shut up %s!
Wallhacks are evil tools of the devil ;)

@KEY " ALWAYS "
That's not always, %s!
I just like it :-)
Come on %s, that was only the second time!

@KEY "ANDROID"
Ah yes, those were the times...
%s was it your first Bot too ?
Does anybody know what DaTa does today ?
You can't play with Android on %m, can you ?

@KEY "BOTMAN"
Who is this botman everybody is talking about???
Visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman
Whithout his sourcecode many bots wouldn't exist!
I wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
Did you play his HPB-Bot yet ?

@KEY " BOT ", "BOTS"
Why are you always talking about them?
There are no bots on this server %s, I tell you!
Bots are cool!!!
What's your favourite bot, %s?
If you want to program your own, ask botman!
Bots, all the time bots - you should start playing with humans.
Most bots are still very stupid!

@KEY "CAMPER", "CAMPING"
I really hate those campers!
Camping sucks!
Don't you camp sometimes %s ?
Camping's often the only option to win...
Yes, good 'ole Camper-Strike...

@KEY "CHEAT"
Those damn cheaters are ruining the entire game!
I suspect that %f is cheating
I hate cheaters!
Cheating sucks!
Why are so many people cheating?
Punkbuster could help...
Play with bots - they don't cheat!

@KEY " CLAN "
What are these clans all about?
I was in a clan once, but it sucked hard.

@KEY " CS ", "COUNTERSTRIKE", "COUNTER-STRIKE", "CSTRIKE"
Counter-Strike is boring nowadays...

CS all the way from the very first beta!
There are too much newbies playing it.
Too many people online cheat in CS
It's not as much fun as it used to be

@KEY " DOD ", "DAY OF DEFEAT"
I don't get what people like in DoD
CS all the way...
%s do you think it will get as popular as CS ?
%s do you prefer DoD over CS ?
Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD, IMHO.

@KEY " ENGINE "
I heard the HL Engine is a hybrid between Quake1 & Quake2, odd huh?
%s, don't you miss the time when an engine was a Software Engine ?
The HL Engine is still quite good, despite its age...

Funnily JoeBot got famous when NNBot quit...
I wonder where else Neural Networks could be applied
So you think JoeBot rocks ?

@KEY "JUMBOT"
JB ? It was good back then but ParaBot is much better now!
JB's advantage has been that it was a MOD, not a hooking DLL
Ah yes, Jumbot and The Fatal. Wonder what he's up to now.
Rumours have it that The Fatal now does AHL Bots ? 

@KEY " MUSIC ", " BAND "
Umm...I don't care as long as it's no commercial shit

Once lovingly called 'the wallhuggers'

@KEY "SCRIPT"
Scripts are for losers
%s, you prolly don't know how to bind keys ?
Did you know that even buying scripts are considered cheating ?

@KEY "SERVER"
I'm always on this Server
Me & my friends play a lot on this Server
I believe this Server's got a good Map Rotation

@KEY "SORRY"
Yeah, afterwards everybody says he's sorry!
The excuse doesn't help me now, %s!
Next time you better think before you start doing something, %s!
I'm sorry, too!
You don't know how sorry you will be for doing that...

@KEY "TEAMKILL", " TK "
