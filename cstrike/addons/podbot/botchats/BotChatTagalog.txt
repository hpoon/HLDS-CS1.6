%v, wala ka palang binatbat sa akin!
Pasensya ka na, %v. Paharang-harang ka kasi eh!
Ang galing mo namang tumakas, %v.
Kailangan kong gawin yon, %v. Naiintindihan mo ba?
Tumakas ka na lang sana habang may pagkakataon,%v.
Ang galing ko talaga, %v. Always.
Naisip kong naaasar ka kapag namatay ka, di ba%v ?
Matuto ka, %v!
Hay, ikaw ha, %v! Sinaktan mo ako ngayon.
Ha...ha!
Wala kang kwenta, %v. Wala talaga.
%v, Nag-aalala ako sa iyo...
Sorry ka %v, ang tama ko sa ulo ay malala kaysa sa iyo hehe.

Nagkakasakit ako kapag tumingin ako sa mga tangang ito.
Oras na ba para naman ibahin ang mapa?
Mga nag-aabang diyan, matalo sana!
Inip na ako !
Siguradong mananalo kami :)
Nanonood na lang, ako bilisan niyo naman...
Sana may sumaling magaling.
Masakit ba hehe.
Ang saya nito.
Hindi ko inisip na matatalo ako, ang sama.
Bakit ba sinasaktan niyo ako parati :)
Visit http://www.geocities.com/countfloyd_1999/
Ang sakit na ng kamay ko...
Ang hirap naman ng mapang ito...
Aba, masama ang araw ko ngayon ah...
Mamatay sana kayong mga abang-ers!
Kailan kaya sila hihintong mag-abang?
Magaling ako sa Quake 3, totoo yon!
Iniisip mo ba na ok pa ang Android BOt?
Si Botman ay isang cool guy...
Mga gagong bots!
Tingnan mo ang mga tangang 'to!
Ang nakababatang kapatid kong babae ay mas magaling pa dyan!
Pagod na ako ngayon...
Gusto ko nang matulog.
Hindi naman ako ganoon kasama kung maglaro!
Wala munang DE_DUST ngayon, please!
Naaasar ako sa mapang ito :(
Sniping lang ang kaya nilang gawin.
Sa susunod na round papatayin na kita.
Ibang mapa naman tayo !!!
Isa ba sa mga bots ang nasiraan na ng ulo?
#32 upto here
Boooooom !!! *lol*
Pagkaloko sa utak, hehe!
I'm sure that Guy used an Aiming Proxy!
Meron bang bots sa larong ito?
Ibibigay mo ba ang Headshot Script mo sa akin?
Sa susunod na round, Stick together tayo team.
Putang ina, pinapatay ang kakampi!!
Di ako magaling sa akyatan...
Tungkol saan ba ang Clans ? Di ko makuha eh
Alam mo ba ang Jumbot ? It really kicks Ass!
If Botman is cool, what is TheFatal then ?
Langhiya, huminto a !!
IMHO NNBot ay mas maganda kaysa RealBot.
Ang sama naman, wala pang bago sa Android Bot.
Maninigarilyo muna ako(kahit masama)...
Bakit nila sinama ang mga sasakyan sa CS?
Magkakarga ako ng bala, pinatay ako!

# Start of the "dynamic" replies from here
# After each @KEY Tag you need to specify the
# keywords in quotation marks and uppercase. You can
# have several keywords (aliases) each separated by a comma.
# After the keywords line, the answers or messages to this
# special keyword need to be given. In theory there can be an unlimited
# number of answers of course you should care about the used memory ;)

%s, things are always repeating - aren't they?
And I'm sure it wasn't the last time...
That's the way things go, hey...

@KEY "AIMBOT", "WALLHACK"

Even PunkBuster fails to detect some of them...
You can't be sure nowadays if someones's good at playing or cheats
Aimbots are cool, shut up %s!
Wallhacks are evil tools of the devil ;)

@KEY " ALWAYS "
That's not always, %s!
I just like it :-)
Come on %s, that was only the second time!

%s was it your first Bot too ?
Does anybody know what DaTa does today ?
You can't play with Android on %m, can you ?

@KEY "BOTMAN"
Who is this botman everybody is talking about???
Visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman
Whithout his sourcecode many bots wouldn't exist!
I wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
Did you play his HPB-Bot yet ?

@KEY " BOT ", "BOTS"
Why are you always talking about them?
There are no bots on this server %s, I tell you!
Bots are cool!!!
What's your favourite bot, %s?
If you want to program your own, ask botman!
Bots, all the time bots - you should start playing with humans.
Most bots are still very stupid!

@KEY "CAMPER", "CAMPING"
I really hate those campers!
Camping sucks!
Don't you camp sometimes %s ?
Camping's often the only option to win...

@KEY " CLAN "
What are these clans all about?
I was in a clan once, but it sucked hard.

There are too much newbies playing it.
Too many people online cheat in CS
It's not as much fun as it used to be

@KEY " DOD ", "DAY OF DEFEAT"
I don't get what people like in DoD
CS all the way...
%s do you think it will get as popular as CS ?
%s do you prefer DoD over CS ?
Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD, IMHO.

@KEY " ENGINE "
I heard the HL Engine is a hybrid between Quake1 & Quake2, odd huh?

Funnily JoeBot got famous when NNBot quit...
I wonder where else Neural Networks could be applied
So you think JoeBot rocks ?

@KEY "JUMBOT"
JB ? It was good back then but ParaBot is much better now!
JB's advantage has been that it was a MOD, not a hooking DLL
Ah yes, Jumbot and The Fatal. Wonder what he's up to now.
Rumours have it that The Fatal now does AHL Bots ? 

@KEY " MUSIC ", " BAND "

Me & my friends play a lot on this Server
I believe this Server's got a good Map Rotation

@KEY "SORRY"
Yeah, afterwards everybody says he's sorry!
