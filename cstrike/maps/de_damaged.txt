Militant Environmentalist Terrorists are 
attempting to blow up either two critical
points in a 1950's era dam facility, 
which has been also set for renovation
by the Bureau of Reclamation .   

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Militant 
Environmentalist Terrorists
from destroying the two critical points.

Terrorists: Destroy either critical point to 
cause a breach in the dam's structural integrity, 
thus allowing the river reclaim its natural 
course and beauty once more.
