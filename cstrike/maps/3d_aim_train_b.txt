3D_AIM_TRAIN_B

By: Squirrelly


The outer bombsite of de_train, site b, made into an aim map. Theres much more 
to come from me and the new line of team3D maps. These maps were originally 
made for teams to practice aim on league maps, They were loved by everyone 
who played them and i eventually gave them to team3D and they took off from 
there. Enjoy!
