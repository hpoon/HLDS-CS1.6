The baby-demon from the good part of hell 
needs our help.  But sitting alone in this 
intergalactic diner one can’t help but wonder 
if we really can help him.  When then Colonel 
calls will you not answer?  We cannot save the 
pudding for desert this time.  We need to look 
into our own eyes and see the light at the end 
of the tunnel.  Even if we need to call upon 
the might of the CrazyTank, the baby-demon 
must be saved.  Only then may we arrive at 
our utopia and only then will we be able to 
dance.
